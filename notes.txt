- Part of Speech Tagging:
It takes too much time to do part-of-speech tagging. The files are too big. Therefore, I used pickle files. I created
two pickle files: one with all the positive label texts and one with all the negative label texts. It's important to use
this because we only need to create these files once and then we can use them for anything we want. Pickle files are
different then just normal files, I'm not sure how it works but it sterilises a file. Anyway, it's really faster than
normal files.
- I looked at: verbs, nouns and adjectives. Please have a look at the POSTAGS.txt file to understand all the
abbrevations / tags. I looked at all types of nouns and all types of verbs. Yet, they are not very informative
